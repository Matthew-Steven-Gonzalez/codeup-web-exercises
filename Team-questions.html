    The unset value defaults the property to the inherited value from the parent element. In laymans terms it reverts to a level above for what property value to use. In this example we look at text color for this in the html there is a change in text color at line 10...
</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <span class="gfg">This line of code will use the unset property value and be the color value inherited by the parenting element ignoring the change on line 10
 </span>
    <br>
    <span>This will follow the change implemented on line 10 </span>

</div>
<div style="text-align: center; color: orange;">
     <span class="gfg">
         This has two levels before reaching default that is why despite being the same class as the previous line it is a different color.
